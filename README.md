# Matlab-Statistics

This project was developed for the Matlab and its Applications in Engineering course, at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. The name of the project, RandX, has been chosen to represent the key element of estimation theory, the random component. The final version of this project will represent a GUI where the user will only need to enter a few parameters in order to obtain information and visualizations for different statistical concepts. This project does not mean to yield a tool that can be used only in an isolated domain of estimation theory, but to provide a general use application, that can be used efficiently in many different fields.
